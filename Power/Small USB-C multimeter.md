## Specs

- 3.9cm × 1.2cm × 0.8cm
- Up to ≈100W

## Notes

- The reported wattage is measurably lower than it should be. The value is close enough to get a sense of what "bucket" of charging speed a device is using (e.g. 30W vs. 65W vs. 100W), but I wouldn't really trust the final digit. For example:
	- Reporting 1-2W instead of 3W
	- Reporting 3W instead of 4-5W
	- Reporting 85W instead of 92W.
- The wattage display is dimmer than other multi-meters like the [USB-C + USB-A multimeter](USB-C%20+%20USB-A%20multimeter.md) or some watt meters built into cables. This isn't really an issue indoors but can make it hard to read outdoors.
