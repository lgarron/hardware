## Notes

This is the fastest charger I've been able to use reliably in my car (internal combustion + 12V battery). It provides ≈65W indefinitely, whereas "100W" chargers tend to reset regularly.

I leave the 30W port permanently connected to a phone charger, leaving the 65W for a laptop or any on-the-go charging. I rarely use the USB-A port, although it can be useful if you have to charge something on the go that only has a USB-A cable available.
