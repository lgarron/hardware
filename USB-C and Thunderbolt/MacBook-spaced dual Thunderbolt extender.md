## Specs

- 2.75cm × 22.5cm × 0.6cm
- Short enough to pass through USB-C and Thunderbolt at full power and speed

## Notes

I don't use this as an extender, but rather to plug in two Thunderbolt cables at once. I leave the two cables plugged into one side semi-permanently, and plug the other side into my laptop whenever I return to my desk. This is not only more convenient, but it also avoids wearing out the connectors on the expensive Thunderbolt cables.

(Why two cables? I have two cables because I want both my monitor and USB hub to each have full Thunderbolt bandwidth at minimal latency. I've tried daisy-chaining each to the other, but that tends to run into issues with bandwidth, latency, heating, or inability to wake the computer with my keyboard/mouse.)
